--Pre-Project Notes and Reflection--
This project was designed to teach me basic CSS work and learn how to build a webpage by deconstructing an established one.

I took the Responsive Web Certification course on FreeCodeCamp.com, and while I found the projects at the end useful, I'm excited to see practical examples of how web pages get done and how to incorporate them into my own project.

I'm not the creative type, and I don't think I want to regularly work with CSS in my future career, but I'm excited to develop the skill.
