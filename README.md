--Pre-Project Notes and Reflection--
This project was designed to teach me basic CSS work and learn how to build a webpage by deconstructing an established one.

I took the Responsive Web Certification course on FreeCodeCamp.com, and while I found the projects at the end useful, I'm excited to see practical examples of how web pages get done and how to incorporate them into my own project.

I'm not the creative type, and I don't think I want to regularly work with CSS in my future career, but I'm excited to develop the skill.

--Post Project Reactions--
I had a very difficult time with positioning the navigation bars, which really shouldn't be the challenging part.  I remembered a lot about using the unordered lists and floating them left/right to create the navigation bars I wanted, but getting them to stay at the top/bottom, while not messing up the readability was harder than it needed to be.  Specifically, whenever I set the position of the navbars to "fixed," the right side of the navigation bar became unreadable, even with the width set to 100%.  I think I had some padding issue or maybe just didn't have the css applying to the correct element because, looking back at the code now, I'm not sure where my mistake was.

I was proud of myself for using a flex grid for the Google Logo and search bar, even if i had to look up the syntax to make the grid grow as a column.

I only really used property inspector to get the size of things down like buttons or image size.  I have no designer bone in my body, so I have no idea what looks good.

I learned a lot simply because doing more of these projects will help solidify concepts.  I want to google syntax less (for example how to remove list-type/decoration from lists), but overall I'm happy with the way this went.
